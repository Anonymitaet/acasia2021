If in the past Apache Doris mainly served high-performance online real-time analysis scenarios, the release of version 1.2 at the end of 2022 undoubtedly marks a further expansion of Apache Doris' capability boundaries. More and more users are starting to build efficient real-time data analysis services based on Apache Doris, and the recently released version 2.0 has comprehensively strengthened Apache Doris' capabilities in scenarios such as semi-structured data analysis, mixed workloads, and data lake federation analysis. In this presentation, I will unveil the latest and most important features of Apache Doris 2.0. At the same time, based on the community's research and development direction over the past few years, I will share the important development directions and detailed plans for version iteration in the future.
