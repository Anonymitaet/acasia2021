In our digital world, open-source software has become part of the infrastructure, like roads and bridges, playing an increasingly important role. However, as the open-source ecosystem continues to evolve, we also face many challenges. Open-source software supply chain security, sustainable development, and how to handle the relationship between open source and business have become urgent issues that need to be addressed in the open-source world. In this roundtable discussion, we will explore the challenges facing the open-source world and possible solutions together with senior members of the Apache Software Foundation.
